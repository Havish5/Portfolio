# Portfolio
This is an HTML file for a personal portfolio website. The file includes a header with a title and a CSS stylesheet, a navigation bar with links to various pages, and a hero section with a large image and a call-to-action button. The hero section also includes a title, a headline with the website owner's name, a brief description of their work, and another call-to-action button.

The CSS stylesheet referenced in the HTML file is likely used to style the website's layout, typography, and visual design.

Note that this HTML file only includes the basic structure and content for the website. More files, such as additional HTML pages, images, and a more comprehensive CSS file, would be necessary to create a fully functional and visually appealing website.
